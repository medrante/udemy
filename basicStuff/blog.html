	<h2>Hello!</h2>
	
	<p class="quote">
		My name Trinia Gene L. Medrano. A mouthful isn't it? Filipino names are usually long in nature. My name is actually a combination of my grandparents' names. "Tri" from Trinidad, my paternal grandmother; "nia" from Patrocinia, my maternal grandmother; and "Gene" from Eugenio, my paternal grandfather. My name is my inheritance, a treasure that I will proudly tell everyone about.

	<p>Before I tell you more, let me just preface this bio page with this: I would not have gotten this far without God and the support of my friends and family. Everything I do is impacted by them. Now, let's go on.</p>

	<p>I will enter my third year of Computer Engineering this fall. My love for technology grew when I realized how privileged I am to be able to access such things and how much I can have an impact in the world. Many third world countries do not have the resources to implement such technology. Coming from the Philippines, I experienced the differences of how these technological resources can change a childâ€™s education for the better. Now you know why I chose that quote on my home page. Every chance I get, I make sure that I am moving toward that goal to eventually give back to my home country through my skills.</p>

		This past year has been a whirlwind, to say the least. After finishing my self-guided tour around South Korea, I visited my hometown in the Philippines for two months, where I ate fresh food, jumped off a tiny cliff, and breathed in the fresh air in the provinces. For a week, I along with other cadets from AFROTC got to be live patients in the Air Mobility Guardian Exercise in Washington. After that, I was off to Erie, Pennsylvania for another adventure. I thought this would be a fun one, but that was not the case. At least now I know that I will not be accepting co-ops in small cities no matter how fun and interesting the work is. I am thankful and blessed for completing this stage of my life even with all the travelling, working in my first co-op, balancing Air Force ROTC commitments, juggling a heavy school load, and going through Field Training.  Check out my Year Two in Review for more.

	<p>Aside from Air Force ROTC and school, I regularly volunteer at Crossroads Church, climb at the UC climbing wall, and do road trips with my family. I also love donuts and coffee. I love travelling, and I was able to go on my first solo trip abroad in the summer of 2017. Visiting South Korea was part of an Honors Program experience, but I took the chance to fly to the Philippines for a couple months before I came back to my busy academic life. If you want to know what I did in South Korea, check out my Experiences. If you want to know what I did in the Philippines (send me an email). </p>

	<p>TLDR; Faith, family, friends, passion, and hard work are where it's at. You may have all these dreams in mind; but without those five things, you probably won't get that far.</p>
